- 👋 Hi, I’m Misoko, aka TSL, aka Bui Thi Ninh Ninh, aka ClatteringJade.
- 👀 I’m interested in dipping my finger into everyone's pie. Hide yo pies if you wanna, but I think there's too many pies in my sight atm.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, French, Vietnamese, Mandarin, cardistry, 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really. I'm unofficially experienced in digital illustration, photo-manipulation, editing, ghostwriting, programming, tutoring, mediating, and most importantly, meme gathering.
- 📫 How to reach me: well... don't they have private messages here? No? Well, you can comment on this yes? I dunno. I might not answer in time, though.
