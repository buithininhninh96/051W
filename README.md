👋 Hi, I’m Misoko, aka TSL, aka Bui Thi Ninh Ninh, aka ClatteringJade.
👀 I’m interested in dipping my finger into everyone's pie. Hide yo pies if you wanna, but I think there's too many pies in my sight atm.
🌱 I’m currently learning Python, French, Vietnamese, Mandarin, cardistry, 
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really. I'm unofficially experienced in digital illustration, photo-manipulation, editing, ghostwriting, programming, tutoring, mediating, and most importantly, meme gathering.
📫 How to reach me:
