Greetings and salutations! I am Bui Thi Ninh Ninh, but sometimes I go by Misoko or Ling.

My hobbies and interests are vast and plentiful. Currently, I am juggling between teaching and programming. I seldomly produce digital illustrations.

At the moment, I am embarking on a journey to further my skills as a full-stack MERN developer.

I am open to collaborations, although I may have to be picky in my selections. I've experiences in digital illustration, photo-manipulation, editing, ghostwriting, programming, tutoring, mediating, and most importantly, research.
